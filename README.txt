## 📊 Project Overview: Real Estate Performance Analysis

This repository contains the analysis for a real estate performance and strategic growth project.

---

### 💻 Analysis Environment & Setup

The primary analysis was conducted using **Google Colab notebooks**. This environment was chosen because the source data resided in **Google Sheets**, allowing for seamless, direct integration.

* **Execution:** The Colab notebooks are set up to run immediately for anyone with link visibility, facilitating easy reproduction and review of the analysis. Access requires Google authentication for secure data integration.
  
* **Local Use:** A copy of the Python notebook (`.ipynb` file) is included here. **Note:** If running the notebook locally (outside of Colab), the Google Sheets integration for reading data will fail. For local execution, please update the data reading commands to use `pd.read_csv` against local data files instead.

### 🧠 Methodology

The project followed the **OSEMN Framework** for data analysis (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret). The detailed steps for each phase are visible within the Table of Contents of the Colab notebook.
